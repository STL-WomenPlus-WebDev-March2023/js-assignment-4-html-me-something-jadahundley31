               Spider plants are the easiest &amp; safest plants to have in your home.
               I got Charlotte last year, around December, from a coworker. I was telling her how I
               wanted to get into planting, but did not know what plants to look for. As a gift, she 
               gave me Charlotte. Her parents had a ton of spider plants throughout their house, so she
               was glad to give some away.

               I water Charlotte every five days, or sometimes I would wait longer depending on how dry 
               the soil is. I use to put her under a grow light for light source. However, she has gotten 
               so big, she has to live on the floor next to my window. Every once in a while I would place 
               her on my window sill to catch the sunshine. The website I use as a resource to take care of 
               Charlotte can be found <a href="https://bloomscape.com/plant-care-guide/spider-plant/">here</a>.

               Charlotte is growing like crazy &amp; I can't wait to plant her into bigger vases!
